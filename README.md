Title: "YouTube Clone: HTML, CSS, JavaScript"

Description: "Embarking on web development, I crafted a YouTube clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With meticulous attention, I replicated the platform's layout and core features. HTML provided the foundation, CSS ensured visual fidelity, and JavaScript added interactivity. From video playback to dynamic search functionality, the clone closely resembled the original. This project sharpened my coding skills and deepened my understanding of modern web applications."
